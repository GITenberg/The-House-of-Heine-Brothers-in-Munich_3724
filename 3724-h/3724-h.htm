<h1>THE HOUSE OF HEINE BROTHERS, IN MUNICH.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> house of Heine Brothers, in
Munich, was of good repute at the time of which I am about to
tell,&mdash;a time not long ago; and is so still, I trust.&nbsp;
It was of good repute in its own way, seeing that no man doubted
the word or solvency of Heine Brothers; but they did not possess,
as bankers, what would in England be considered a large or
profitable business.&nbsp; The operations of English bankers are
bewildering in their magnitude.&nbsp; Legions of clerks are
employed.&nbsp; The senior book-keepers, though only salaried
servants, are themselves great men; while the real partners are
inscrutable, mysterious, opulent beyond measure, and altogether
unknown to their customers.&nbsp; Take any firm at
random,&mdash;Brown, Jones, and Cox, let us say,&mdash;the
probability is that Jones has been dead these fifty years, that
Brown is a Cabinet Minister, and that Cox is master of a pack of
hounds in Leicestershire.&nbsp; But it was by no means so with
the house of Heine Brothers, of Munich.&nbsp; There they were,
the two elderly men, daily to be seen at their dingy office in
the Schrannen Platz; and if any business was to be transacted
requiring the interchange of more than a word or two, it was the
younger brother with whom the customer was, as a matter of
course, brought into contact.&nbsp; There were three clerks in
the establishment; an old man, namely, who sat with the elder
brother and had no personal dealings with the public; a young
Englishman, of whom we shall anon hear more; and a boy who ran
messages, put the wood on to the stoves, and swept out the
bank.&nbsp; Truly he house of Heine Brothers was of no great
importance; but nevertheless it was of good repute.</p>
<p>The office, I have said, was in the Schrannen Platz, or old
Market-place.&nbsp; Munich, as every one knows, is chiefly to be
noted as a new town,&mdash;so new that many of the streets and
most of the palaces look as though they had been sent home last
night from the builders, and had only just been taken out of
their bandboxes. It is angular, methodical, unfinished, and
palatial.&nbsp; But there is an old town; and, though the old
town be not of surpassing interest, it is as dingy, crooked,
intricate, and dark as other old towns in Germany.&nbsp; Here, in
the old Market-place, up one long broad staircase, were situated
the two rooms in which was held the bank of Heine Brothers.</p>
<p>Of the elder member of the firm we shall have something to say
before this story be completed.&nbsp; He was an old bachelor, and
was possessed of a bachelor&rsquo;s dwelling somewhere out in the
suburbs of the city.&nbsp; The junior brother was a married man,
with a wife some twenty years younger than himself, with two
daughters, the elder of whom was now one-and-twenty, and one
son.&nbsp; His name was Ernest Heine, whereas the senior brother
was known as Uncle Hatto.&nbsp; Ernest Heine and his wife
inhabited a portion of one of those new palatial residences at
the further end of the Ludwigs Strasse; but not because they thus
lived must it be considered that they were palatial people.&nbsp;
By no means let it be so thought, as such an idea would
altogether militate against whatever truth of character painting
there may be in this tale.&nbsp; They were not palatial people,
but the very reverse, living in homely guise, pursuing homely
duties, and satisfied with homely pleasures.&nbsp; Up two pairs
of stairs, however, in that street of palaces, they lived, having
there a commodious suite of large rooms, furnished, after the
manner of the Germans, somewhat gaudily as regarded their best
salon, and with somewhat meagre comfort as regarded their other
rooms.&nbsp; But, whether in respect of that which was meagre, or
whether in respect of that which was gaudy, they were as well off
as their neighbours; and this, as I take it, is the point of
excellence which is desirable.</p>
<p>Ernest Heine was at this time over sixty; his wife was past
forty; and his eldest daughter, as I have said, was twenty-one
years of age.&nbsp; His second child, also a girl, was six years
younger; and their third child, a boy, had not been born till
another similar interval had elapsed.&nbsp; He was named Hatto
after his uncle, and the two girls had been christened Isa and
Agnes.&nbsp; Such, in number and mode of life, was the family of
the Heines.</p>
<p>We English folk are apt to imagine that we are nearer akin to
Germans than to our other continental neighbours.&nbsp; This may
be so in blood, but, nevertheless, the difference in manners is
so striking, that it could hardly be enhanced.&nbsp; An
Englishman moving himself off to a city in the middle of Central
America will find the customs to which he must adapt himself less
strange to him there, than he would in many a German town.&nbsp;
But in no degree of life is the difference more remarkable than
among unmarried but marriageable young women.&nbsp; It is not my
purpose at the present moment to attribute a superiority in this
matter to either nationality.&nbsp; Each has its own charm, its
own excellence, its own Heaven-given grace, whereby men are led
up to purer thoughts and sweet desires; and each may possibly
have its own defect.&nbsp; I will not here describe the
excellence or defect of either; but will, if it be in my power,
say a word as to this difference.&nbsp; The German girl of
one-and-twenty,&mdash;our Isa&rsquo;s age,&mdash;is more sedate,
more womanly, more meditative than her English sister.&nbsp; The
world&rsquo;s work is more in her thoughts, and the world&rsquo;s
amusements less so.&nbsp; She probably knows less of those things
which women learn than the English girl, but that which she does
know is nearer to her hand for use.&nbsp; She is not so much
accustomed to society, but nevertheless she is more mistress of
her own manner.&nbsp; She is not taught to think so much of those
things which flurry and disturb the mind, and therefore she is
seldom flurried and disturbed.&nbsp; To both of them,
love,&mdash;the idea of love,&mdash;must be the thought of all
the most absorbing; for is it not fated for them that the joys
and sorrows of their future life must depend upon it?&nbsp; But
the idea of the German girl is the more realistic, and the less
romantic.&nbsp; Poetry and fiction she may have read, though of
the latter sparingly; but they will not have imbued her with that
hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so often
fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home.&nbsp;
She is moderate in her aspirations, requiring less excitement
than an English girl; and never forgetting the solid necessities
of life,&mdash;as they are so often forgotten here in
England.&nbsp; In associating with young men, an English girl
will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find
an admirer whom she may possibly love, or an admirer whom she may
probably be called on to repel.&nbsp; She is ever conscious of
the fact of this position; and a romance is thus engendered
which, if it may at times be dangerous, is at any rate always
charming.&nbsp; But the German girl, in her simplicity, has no
such consciousness.&nbsp; As you and I, my reader, might probably
become dear friends were we to meet and know each other, so may
the German girl learn to love the fair-haired youth with whom
chance has for a time associated her; but to her mind there
occurs no suggestive reason why it should be so,&mdash;no
probability that the youth may regard her in such light, because
that chance has come to pass.&nbsp; She can therefore give him
her hand without trepidation, and talk with him for half an hour,
when called on to do so, as calmly as she might do with his
sister.</p>
<p>Such a one was Isa Heine at the time of which I am
writing.&nbsp; We English, in our passion for daily excitement,
might call her phlegmatic, but we should call her so
unjustly.&nbsp; Life to her was a serious matter, of which the
daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her
thoughts.&nbsp; She was her mother&rsquo;s companion, the
instructress of both her brother and her sister, and the charm of
her father&rsquo;s vacant hours.&nbsp; With such calls upon her
time, and so many realities around her, her imagination did not
teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and
home.&nbsp; When love and marriage should come to her, as come
they probably might, she would endeavour to attune herself to a
new happiness and a new sphere of duties.&nbsp; In the meantime
she was contented to keep her mother&rsquo;s accounts, and look
after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the Ludwigs
Strasse.&nbsp; But change would certainly come, we may prophesy;
for Isa Heine was a beautiful girl, tall and graceful, comely to
the eye, and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the
partner of a man&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>I have said that an English clerk made a part of that small
establishment in the dingy banking-office in the Schrannen Platz,
and I must say a word or two of Herbert Onslow.&nbsp; In his
early career he had not been fortunate.&nbsp; His father, with
means sufficiently moderate, and with a family more than
sufficiently large, had sent him to a public school at which he
had been very idle, and then to one of the universities, at which
he had run into debt, and had therefore left without a
degree.&nbsp; When this occurred, a family council of war had
been held among the Onslows, and it was decided that Herbert
should be sent off to the banking-house of Heines, at Munich,
there being a cousinship between the families, and some existing
connections of business.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, so settled; and Herbert, willing enough to
see the world,&mdash;as he considered he should do by going to
Munich,&mdash;started for his German home, with injunctions, very
tender from his mother, and very solemn from his aggrieved
father.&nbsp; But there was nothing bad at the heart about young
Onslow, and if the solemn father had well considered it, he might
perhaps have felt that those debts at Cambridge reflected more
fault on him than on his son.&nbsp; When Herbert arrived at
Munich, his cousins, the Heines,&mdash;far-away cousins though
they were,&mdash;behaved kindly to him.&nbsp; They established
him at first in lodgings, where he was boarded with many others,
having heard somewhat of his early youth.&nbsp; But when Madame
Heine, at the end of twelve months, perceived that he was
punctual at the bank, and that his allowances, which, though
moderate in England, were handsome in Munich, carried him on
without debt, she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his
mother and to himself, that he should live with them.&nbsp; In
this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the
palatial residence in the Ludwigs Strasse.</p>
<p>But all this happened long ago.&nbsp; Isa Heine had been only
seventeen when her cousin had first come to Munich, and had made
acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman.&nbsp;
And when, as she ripened into womanhood, this young man came more
closely among them, it did not strike her that the change would
affect her more powerfully than it would the others.&nbsp; Her
uncle and father, she knew, had approved of Herbert at the bank;
and Herbert had shown that he could be steady; therefore he was
to be taken into their family, paying his annual subsidy, instead
of being left with strangers at the boarding-house.&nbsp; All
this was very simple to her.&nbsp; She assisted in mending his
linen, as she did her father&rsquo;s; she visited his room daily,
as she visited all the others; she took notice of his likings and
dislikings as touching their table arrangement,&mdash;but by no
means such notice as she did of her father&rsquo;s; and without
any flutter, inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded
the world, she made him one of the family.&nbsp; So things went
on for a year,&mdash;nay, so things went on for two years with
her, after Herbert Onslow had come to the Ludwigs Strasse.</p>
<p>But the matter had been regarded in a very different light by
Herbert himself.&nbsp; When the proposition had been made to him,
his first idea had been that so close a connection with, a girl
so very pretty would be delightful.&nbsp; He had blushed as he
had given in his adhesion; but Madame Heine, when she saw the
blush, had attributed it to anything but the true cause.&nbsp;
When Isa had asked him as to his wants and wishes, he had blushed
again, but she had been as ignorant as her mother.&nbsp; The
father had merely stipulated that, as the young Englishman paid
for his board, he should have the full value of his money, so
that Isa and Agnes gave up their pretty front room, going into
one that was inferior, and Hatto was put to sleep in the little
closet that had been papa&rsquo;s own peculiar property.&nbsp;
But nobody complained of this, for it was understood that the
money was of service.</p>
<p>For the first year Herbert found that nothing especial
happened.&nbsp; He always fancied that he was in love with Isa,
and wrote some poetry about her.&nbsp; But the poetry was in
English, and Isa could not read it, even had he dared to show it
to her.&nbsp; During the second year he went home to England for
three months, and by confessing a passion to one of his sisters,
really brought himself to feel one.&nbsp; He returned to Munich
resolved to tell Isa that the possibility of his remaining there
depended upon her acceptance of his heart; but for months he did
not find himself able to put his resolution in force.&nbsp; She
was so sedate, so womanly, so attentive as regarded cousinly
friendship, and so cold as regarded everything else, that he did
not know how to speak to her.&nbsp; With an English girl whom he
had met three times at a ball, he might have been much more able
to make progress.&nbsp; He was alone with Isa frequently, for
neither father, mother, nor Isa herself objected to such
communion; but yet things so went between them that he could not
take her by the hand and tell her that he loved her.&nbsp; And
thus the third year of his life in Munich, and the second of his
residence in the Ludwigs Strasse, went by him.&nbsp; So the years
went by, and Isa was now past twenty.&nbsp; To Herbert, in his
reveries, it seemed as though life, and the joys of life, were
slipping away from him.&nbsp; But no such feeling disturbed any
of the Heines.&nbsp; Life of course, was slipping away; but then
is it not the destiny of man that life should slip away?&nbsp;
Their wants were all satisfied, and for them, that, together with
their close family affection, was happiness enough.</p>
<p>At last, however, Herbert so spoke, or so looked, that both
Isa and her mother saw that his heart was touched.&nbsp; He still
declared to himself that he had made no sign, and that he was an
oaf, an ass, a coward, in that he had not done so.&nbsp; But he
had made some sign, and the sign had been read.&nbsp; There was
no secret,&mdash;no necessity for a secret on the subject between
the mother and daughter, but yet it was not spoken of all at
once.&nbsp; There was some little increase of caution between
them as Herbert&rsquo;s name was mentioned, so that gradually
each knew what the other thought; but for weeks, that was
all.&nbsp; Then at last the mother spoke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think that Herbert
Onslow is becoming attached to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never said so, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am sure he has not.&nbsp; Had he done so, you
would have told me.&nbsp; Nevertheless, is it not
true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mamma, I cannot say.&nbsp; It may be so.&nbsp;
Such an idea has occurred to me, but I have abandoned it as
needless.&nbsp; If he has anything to say he will say
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he were to speak, how should you answer
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should take time to think.&nbsp; I do not at all know
what means he has for a separate establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
the subject was dropped between them for that time, and Isa, in
her communications with her cousin, was somewhat more reserved
than she had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isa, are you in love with Herbert?&rdquo; Agnes asked
her, as they were together in their room one night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In love with him?&nbsp; No; why should I be in love
with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is in love with you,&rdquo; said Agnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite another thing,&rdquo; said Isa,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if so, he has not taken me into his
confidence.&nbsp; Perhaps he has you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no.&nbsp; He would not do that, I think.&nbsp; Not
but what we are great friends, and I love him dearly.&nbsp; Would
it not be nice for you and him to be betrothed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on many things, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I know.&nbsp; Perhaps he has not got money
enough.&nbsp; But you could live here, you know, and he has got
some money, because he so often rides on horseback.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then the matter was dropped between the two sisters.</p>
<p>Herbert had given English lessons to the two girls, but the
lessons had been found tedious, and had dwindled away.&nbsp; Isa,
nevertheless, had kept up her exercises, duly translating German
into English, and English into German; and occasionally she had
shown them to her cousin.&nbsp; Now, however, she altogether gave
over such showing of them, but, nevertheless, worked at the task
with more energy than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isa,&rdquo; he said to her one day,&mdash;having with
some difficulty found her alone in the parlour, &ldquo;Isa, why
should not we go on with our English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is troublesome,&mdash;to you I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troublesome.&nbsp; Well; yes; it is troublesome.&nbsp;
Nothing good is to be had without trouble.&nbsp; But I should
like it if you would not mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how sick you were of it before;&mdash;besides,
I shall never be able to speak it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not get sick of it now, Isa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes you would;&mdash;in two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I want you to speak it.&nbsp; I desire it
especially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why especially?&rdquo; asked Isa.&nbsp; And even she,
with all her tranquillity of demeanour, could hardly preserve her
even tone and quiet look, as she asked the necessary
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you why,&rdquo; said Herbert; and as he
spoke, he got up from his seat, and took a step or two over
towards her, where she was sitting near the window.&nbsp; Isa, as
she saw him, still continued her work, and strove hard to give to
the stitches all that attention which they required.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will tell you why I would wish you to talk my
language.&nbsp; Because I love you, Isa, and would have you for
my wife,&mdash;if that be possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still continued her work, and the stitches, if not quite
as perfect as usual, sufficed for their purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why I wish it.&nbsp; Now will you consent to
learn from me again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, Herbert, that consent would include
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; certainly it would.&nbsp; That is what I
intend.&nbsp; And now will you learn from me again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is,&mdash;you mean to ask, will I marry
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you love me?&nbsp; Can you learn to love me?&nbsp;
Oh, Isa, I have thought of this so long!&nbsp; But you have
seemed so cold that I have not dared to speak.&nbsp; Isa, can you
love me?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he sat himself close beside her.&nbsp;
Now that the ice was broken, he was quite prepared to become an
ardent lover,&mdash;if she would allow of such ardour.&nbsp; But
as he sat down she rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot answer such a question on the sudden,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me till to-morrow, Herbert, and then
I will make you a reply;&rdquo; whereupon she left him, and he
stood alone in the room, having done the deed on which he had
been meditating for the last two years.&nbsp; About half an hour
afterwards he met her on the stairs as he was going to his
chamber.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I speak to your father about
this,&rdquo; he said, hardly stopping her as he asked the
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes; surely,&rdquo; she answered; and
then again they parted.&nbsp; To him this last-accorded
permission sounded as though it carried with it more weight than
it in truth possessed.&nbsp; In his own country a reference to
the lady&rsquo;s father is taken as indicating a full consent on
the lady&rsquo;s part, should the stern paterfamilias raise no
objection.&nbsp; But Isa had no such meaning.&nbsp; She had told
him that she could not give her answer till the morrow.&nbsp; If,
however, he chose to consult her father on the subject, she had
no objection.&nbsp; It would probably be necessary that she
should discuss the whole matter in family conclave, before she
could bring herself to give any reply.</p>
<p>On that night, before he went to bed, he did speak to her
father; and Isa also, before she went to rest, spoke to her
mother.&nbsp; It was singular to him that there should appear to
be so little privacy on the subject; that there should be held to
be so little necessity for a secret.&nbsp; Had he made a
suggestion that an extra room should be allotted to him at so
much per annum, the proposition could not have been discussed
with simpler ease.&nbsp; At last, after a three days&rsquo;
debate, the matter ended thus,&mdash;with by no means a
sufficiency of romance for his taste.&nbsp; Isa had agreed to
become his betrothed if certain pecuniary conditions should or
could be fulfilled.&nbsp; It appeared now that Herbert&rsquo;s
father had promised that some small modicum of capital should be
forthcoming after a term of years, and that Heine Brothers had
agreed that the Englishman should have a proportionate share in
the bank when that promise should be brought to bear.&nbsp; Let
it not be supposed that Herbert would thus become a
millionaire.&nbsp; If all went well, the best would be that some
three hundred a year would accrue to him from the bank, instead
of the quarter of that income which he at present received.&nbsp;
But three hundred a year goes a long way at Munich, and
Isa&rsquo;s parents were willing that she should be
Herbert&rsquo;s wife if such an income should be forthcoming.</p>
<p>But even of this there was much doubt.&nbsp; Application to
Herbert&rsquo;s father could not be judiciously made for some
months.&nbsp; The earliest period at which, in accordance with
old Hatto Heine&rsquo;s agreement, young Onslow might be admitted
to the bank, was still distant by four years; and the present
moment was thought to be inopportune for applying to him for any
act of grace.&nbsp; Let them wait, said papa and mamma
Heine,&mdash;at any rate till New Year&rsquo;s Day, then ten
months distant.&nbsp; Isa quietly said that she would wait till
New Year&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; Herbert fretted, fumed, and declared
that he was ill-treated.&nbsp; But in the end he also agreed to
wait.&nbsp; What else could he do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shall see each other daily, and be close to each
other,&rdquo; he said to Isa, looking tenderly into her
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;we shall see
each other daily&mdash;of course.&nbsp; But,
Herbert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert looked up at her and paused for her to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have promised mamma that there shall be no change
between us,&mdash;in our manner to each other, I mean.&nbsp; We
are not betrothed as yet, you know, and perhaps we may never be
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be possible, you know.&nbsp; And therefore
we will go on as before.&nbsp; Of course we shall see each other,
and of course we shall be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbert Onslow again fretted and again fumed, but he did not
have his way.&nbsp; He had looked forward to the ecstasies of a
lover&rsquo;s life, but very few of those ecstasies were awarded
to him.&nbsp; He rarely found himself alone with Isa, and when he
did do so, her coldness overawed him.&nbsp; He could dare to
scold her and sometimes did do so, but he could not dare to take
the slightest liberty.&nbsp; Once, on that night when the
qualified consent of papa and mamma Heine had first been given,
he had been allowed to touch her lips with his own; but since
that day there had been for him no such delight as that.&nbsp;
She would not even allow her hand to remain in his.&nbsp; When
they all passed their evenings together in the beer-garden, she
would studiously manage that his chair should not be close to her
own.&nbsp; Occasionally she would walk with him, but not more
frequently now than of yore.&nbsp; Very few, indeed, of a
lover&rsquo;s privileges did he enjoy.&nbsp; And in this way the
long year wore itself out, and Isa Heine was one-and-twenty.</p>
<p>All those family details which had made it inexpedient to
apply either to old Hatto or to Herbert&rsquo;s father before the
end of the year need not be specially explained.&nbsp; Old Hatto,
who had by far the greater share in the business, was a tyrant
somewhat feared both by his brother and sister-in-law; and the
elder Onslow, as was known to them all, was a man straitened in
circumstances.&nbsp; But soon after New Year&rsquo;s Day the
proposition was made in the Schrannen Platz, and the letter was
written.&nbsp; On this occasion Madame Heine went down to the
bank, and together with her husband, was closeted for an hour
with old Hatto.&nbsp; Uncle Hatto&rsquo;s verdict was not
favourable.&nbsp; As to the young people&rsquo;s marriage, that
was his brother&rsquo;s affair, not his.&nbsp; But as to the
partnership, that was a serious matter.&nbsp; Who ever heard of a
partnership being given away merely because a man wanted to
marry?&nbsp; He would keep to his promise, and if the stipulated
moneys were forthcoming, Herbert Onslow should become a
partner,&mdash;in four years.&nbsp; Nor was the reply from
England more favourable.&nbsp; The alliance was regarded by all
the Onslows very favourably.&nbsp; Nothing could be nicer than
such a marriage!&nbsp; They already knew dear Isa so well by
description!&nbsp; But as for the money,&mdash;that could not in
any way be forthcoming till the end of the stipulated period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall we do?&rdquo; said Herbert to Papa
Heine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must wait,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For four years?&rdquo; asked Herbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must wait,&mdash;as I did,&rdquo; said Papa
Heine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was forty before I could
marry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Papa Heine, however, should not have
forgotten to say that his bride was only twenty, and that if he
had waited, she had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isa,&rdquo; Herbert said to her, when all this had been
fully explained to her, &ldquo;what do you say now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is all over,&rdquo; said she, very
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Isa, is that your love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Herbert, that is not my love; that is my
discretion;&rdquo; and she even laughed with her mild low
laughter, as she answered him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know you are too
impatient to wait four years, and what else therefore can I
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether you love me?&rdquo; said Herbert, with
a grand look of injured sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; in your sense of the word I do not think I
do.&nbsp; I do not love you so that I need make every one around
us unhappy because circumstances forbid me to marry you.&nbsp;
That sort of love would be baneful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no, you do not know what love means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your boisterous, heartbreaking English love,
Herbert.&nbsp; And, Herbert, sometimes I think you had better go
home and look for a bride there.&nbsp; Though you fancy that you
love me, in your heart you hardly approve of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy that I love you!&nbsp; Do you think, Isa, that a
man can carry his heart round to one customer after another as
the huckster carries his wares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think he can.&nbsp; I know that men do.&nbsp;
What did your hero Waverley do with his heart in that grand
English novel which you gave me to read?&nbsp; I am not Flora Mac
Ivor, but you may find a Rose Bradwardine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really wish me to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Herbert.&nbsp; It is bad to boast, but I
will make this boast.&nbsp; I am so little selfish, that I desire
above all that you should do that which may make you most happy
and contented.&nbsp; I will be quite frank with you.&nbsp; I love
you well enough to wait these four years with the hope of
becoming your wife when they are over.&nbsp; But you will think
but little of my love when I tell you that this waiting would not
make me unhappy.&nbsp; I should go on as I do now, and be
contented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh heavens!&rdquo; sighed Herbert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as I know that this would not suit you,&mdash;as I
feel sure that such delay would gall you every day, as I doubt
whether it would not make you sick of me long before the four
years be over,&mdash;my advice is, that we should let this matter
drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now walked up to her and took her hand, and as he did so
there was something in his gait and look and tone of voice that
stirred her heart more sharply than it had yet been
stirred.&nbsp; &ldquo;And even that would not make you
unhappy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She paused before she replied, leaving her hand in his, for he
was contented to hold it without peculiar pressure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not say so,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
Herbert, I think that you press me too hard.&nbsp; Is it not
enough that I leave you to be the arbiter of my
destiny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would learn the very truth of your heart,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you that truth more plainly.&nbsp;
Methinks I have told it too plainly already.&nbsp; If you wish
it, I will hold myself as engaged to you,&mdash;to be married to
you when those four years are past.&nbsp; But, remember, I do not
advise it.&nbsp; If you wish it, you shall have back your
troth.&nbsp; And that I think will be the wiser
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But neither alternative contented Herbert Onslow, and at the
time he did not resolve on either.&nbsp; He had some little
present income from home, some fifty pounds a year or so, and he
would be satisfied to marry on that and on his salary as a clerk;
but to this papa and mamma Heine would not consent;&mdash;neither
would Isa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not a saving, close man,&rdquo; she said to him
when he boasted of his economies.&nbsp; &ldquo;No Englishmen
are.&nbsp; You could not live comfortably in two small rooms, and
with bad dinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care a straw about my dinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now that you are a lover, but you would do when you
were a husband.&nbsp; And you change your linen almost every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; bah, if you please.&nbsp; But I know what these
things cost.&nbsp; You had better go to England and fetch a rich
wife.&nbsp; Then you will become a partner at once, and Uncle
Hatto won&rsquo;t snub you.&nbsp; And you will be a grand man,
and have a horse to ride on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon Herbert went
away in disgust.&nbsp; Nothing in all this made him so unhappy as
the feeling that Isa, under all their joint privations, would not
be unhappy herself.&nbsp; As far as he could see, all this made
no difference in Isa.</p>
<p>But, in truth, he had not yet read Isa&rsquo;s character very
thoroughly.&nbsp; She had spoken truly in saying that she knew
nothing of that boisterous love which was now tormenting him and
making him gloomy; but nevertheless she loved him.&nbsp; She, in
her short life, had learnt many lessons of self-denial; and now
with reference to this half-promised husband she would again have
practised such a lesson.&nbsp; Had he agreed at once to go from
her, she would have balanced her own account within her own
breast, and have kept to herself all her sufferings.&nbsp; There
would have been no outward show of baffled love,&mdash;none even
in the colour of her cheeks; for such was the nature of her
temperament.&nbsp; But she did suffer for him.&nbsp; Day by day
she began to think that his love, though boisterous as she had at
first called it, was more deep-seated than she had
believed.&nbsp; He made no slightest sign that he would accept
any of those proffers which she had made him of release.&nbsp;
Though he said so loudly that this waiting for four years was an
impossibility, he spoke of no course that would be more
possible,&mdash;except that evidently impossible course of an
early marriage.&nbsp; And thus, while he with redoubled vehemence
charged her with coolness and want of love, her love waxed warmer
and warmer, and his happiness became the chief object of her
thoughts.&nbsp; What could she do that he might no longer
suffer?</p>
<p>And then he took a step which was very strange to them
all.&nbsp; He banished himself altogether from the house, going
away again into lodgings.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, on the
morning of his departure, &ldquo;I do not release you.&nbsp; I
will never release you.&nbsp; You are mine, and I have a right so
to call you.&nbsp; If you choose to release yourself, I cannot
help it; but in doing so you will be forsworn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, Herbert, I have sworn to nothing,&rdquo; said
she, meaning that she had not been formally betrothed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do as you please; it is a matter of conscience;
but I tell you what are my feelings.&nbsp; Here I cannot stay,
for I should go mad; but I shall see you
occasionally;&mdash;perhaps on Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Herbert!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what would you have?&nbsp; If you really cared to
see me it would not be thus.&nbsp; All I ask of you now is this,
that if you decide,&mdash;absolutely decide on throwing me over,
you will tell me at once.&nbsp; Then I shall leave
Munich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herbert, I will never throw you over.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
they parted, and Onslow went forth to his new lodgings.</p>
<p>Her promise that she would never throw him over was the
warmest word of love that she had ever spoken, but even that was
said in her own quiet, unimpassioned way.&nbsp; There was in it
but very little show of love, though there might be an assurance
of constancy.&nbsp; But her constancy he did not, in truth, much
doubt.&nbsp; Four years,&mdash;fourteen,&mdash;or twenty-four,
would be the same to her, he said, as he seated himself in the
dull, cold room which he had chosen.&nbsp; While living in the
Ludwigs Strasse he did not know how much had been daily done for
his comfort by that hand which he had been so seldom allowed to
press; but he knew that he was now cold and comfortless, and he
wished himself back in the Ludwigs Strasse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Isa, when they were alone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is not Uncle Hatto rather hard on us?&nbsp; Papa said that
he would ask this as a favour from his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he did, my dear; and offered to give up more of his
own time.&nbsp; But your Uncle Hatto is hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is rich, is he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; your father says not.&nbsp; Your father says that
he spends all his income.&nbsp; Though he is hard and obstinate,
he is not selfish.&nbsp; He is very good to the poor, but I
believe he thinks that early marriages are very
foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Isa again, when they had sat for
some minutes in silence over their work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you spoken to Uncle Hatto about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear; not since that day when your papa and I first
went to him.&nbsp; To tell the truth, I am almost afraid to speak
to him; but, if you wish it, I will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish it, mamma.&nbsp; But you must not think that
I am discontented or impatient.&nbsp; I do not know that I have
any right to ask my uncle for his money;&mdash;for it comes to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it does, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for myself, I am happy here with you and
papa.&nbsp; I do not think so much of these four
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would still be young, Isa;&mdash;quite young
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what if I were not young?&nbsp; What does it
matter?&nbsp; But, mamma, there has been that between Herbert and
me which makes me feel myself bound to think of him.&nbsp; As you
and papa have sanctioned it, you are bound to think of him
also.&nbsp; I know that he is unhappy, living there all
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he go, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he was right to go.&nbsp; I could understand
his doing that.&nbsp; He is not like us, and would have been
fretful here, wanting that which I could not give him.&nbsp; He
became worse from day to day, and was silent and morose.&nbsp; I
am glad he went.&nbsp; But, mamma, for his sake I wish that this
could be shortened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Heine told her daughter that she would, if Isa wished
it, herself go to the Schrannen Platz, and see what could be done
by talking to Uncle Hatto.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;I fear that no good will come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can harm come, mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not think harm can come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, mamma, I will go to Uncle
Hatto myself, if you will let me.&nbsp; He is cross I know; but I
shall not be afraid of him.&nbsp; I feel that I ought to do
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the matter was settled, Madame
Heine being by no means averse to escape a further personal visit
to the Head of the banking establishment.</p>
<p>Madame Heine well understood what her daughter meant, when she
said she ought to do something, though Isa feared that she had
imperfectly expressed her meaning.&nbsp; When he, Herbert, was
willing to do so much to prove his love,&mdash;when he was ready
to sacrifice all the little comforts of comparative wealth to
which he had been accustomed, in order that she might be his
companion and wife,&mdash;did it not behove her to give some
proof of her love also?&nbsp; She could not be demonstrative as
he was.&nbsp; Such exhibition of feeling would be quite contrary
to her ideas of female delicacy, and to her very nature.&nbsp;
But if called on to work for him, that she could do as long as
strength remained to her.&nbsp; But there was no sacrifice which
would be of service, nor any work which would avail.&nbsp;
Therefore she was driven to think what she might do on his
behalf, and at last she resolved to make her personal appeal to
Uncle Hatto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell papa?&rdquo; Isa asked of her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said Madame Heine.&nbsp; And then
the younger member of the firm was informed as to the step which
was to be taken; and he, though he said nothing to forbid the
attempt, held out no hope that it would be successful.</p>
<p>Uncle Hatto was a little snuffy man, now full seventy years of
age, who passed seven hours of every week-day of his life in the
dark back chamber behind the banking-room of the firm, and he had
so passed every week-day of his life for more years than any of
the family could now remember.&nbsp; He had made the house what
it was, and had taken his brother into partnership when that
brother married.&nbsp; All the family were somewhat afraid of
him, including even his partner.&nbsp; He rarely came to the
apartments in the Ludwigs Strasse, as he himself lived in one of
the older and shabbier suburbs on the other side of the
town.&nbsp; Thither he always walked, starting punctually from
the bank at four o&rsquo;clock, and from thence he always walked
in the morning, reaching the bank punctually at nine.&nbsp; His
two nieces knew him well; for on certain stated days they were
wont to attend on him at his lodgings, where they would be
regaled with cakes, and afterwards go with him to some
old-fashioned beer-garden in his neighbourhood.&nbsp; But these
festivities were of a sombre kind; and if, on any occasion,
circumstances prevented the fulfilment of the ceremony, neither
of the girls would be loud in their lamentations.</p>
<p>In London, a visit paid by a niece to her uncle would, in all
probability, be made at the uncle&rsquo;s private residence; but
at Munich private and public matters were not so effectually
divided.&nbsp; Isa therefore, having put on her hat and shawl,
walked off by herself to the Schrannen Platz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Uncle Hatto inside?&rdquo; she asked; and the answer
was given to her by her own lover.&nbsp; Yes, he was within; but
the old clerk was with him.&nbsp; Isa, however, signified her
wish to see her uncle alone, and in a few minutes the ancient
grey-haired servant of the house came out into the larger
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go in now, Miss Isa,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And
Isa found herself in the presence of her uncle before she had
been two minutes under the roof.&nbsp; In the mean time Ernest
Heine, her father, had said not a word, and Herbert knew that
something very special must be about to occur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my bonny bird,&rdquo; said Uncle Hatto,
&ldquo;and what do you want at the bank?&rdquo;&nbsp; Cheery
words, such as these, were by no means uncommon with Uncle Hatto;
but Isa knew very well that no presage could be drawn from them
of any special good nature or temporary weakness on his part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Hatto,&rdquo; she began, rushing at once into the
middle of her affair, &ldquo;you know, I believe, that I am
engaged to marry Herbert Onslow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know no such thing,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought I understood your father specially to say that there had
been no betrothal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Uncle Hatto, there has been no betrothal; that
certainly is true; but, nevertheless, we are engaged to each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Hatto, very sourly; and now
there was no longer any cheery tone, or any calling of pretty
names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you may think all this very foolish,&rdquo;
said Isa, who, spite of her resolves to do so, was hardly able to
look up gallantly into her uncle&rsquo;s face as she thus talked
of her own love affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Uncle Hatto.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do
think it foolish for young people to hold themselves betrothed
before they have got anything to live on, and so I have told your
father.&nbsp; He answered me by saying that you were not
betrothed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor are we.&nbsp; Papa is quite right in
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear, I would advise you to tell the young man
that, as neither of you have means of your own, the thing must be
at an end.&nbsp; It is the only step for you to take.&nbsp; If
you agreed to wait, one of you might die, or his money might
never be forth coming, or you might see somebody else that you
liked better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; And if you don&rsquo;t, the
chances are ten to one that he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little blow, which was intended to be severe, did not hit
Isa at all hard.&nbsp; That plan of a Rose Bradwardine she
herself had proposed in good faith, thinking that she could
endure such a termination to the affair without flinching.&nbsp;
She was probably wrong in this estimate of her power; but,
nevertheless, her present object was his release from unhappiness
and doubt, not her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be so,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my word for it, it would.&nbsp; Look all
around.&nbsp; There was Adelaide Schropner,&mdash;but that was
before your time, and you would not remember.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Considering that Adelaide Schropner had been for many years a
grandmother, it was probable that Isa would not remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Uncle Hatto, you have not heard me.&nbsp; I want
to say something to you, if it will not take too much of your
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; In answer to which, Uncle Hatto muttered
something which was unheeded, to signify that Isa might
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also think that a long engagement is a foolish thing,
and so does Herbert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he wants to marry at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he wants to marry&mdash;perhaps not at once, but
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you have come to say that you want the
same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isa blushed ever so faintly as she commenced her answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, uncle, I do wish the same thing.&nbsp; What he
wishes, I wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&mdash;very likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scornful to me, uncle.&nbsp; When two
people love each other, it is natural that each should wish that
which the other earnestly desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very natural, my dear, that you should wish to get
married!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Hatto, I did not think that you would be unkind
to me, though I knew that you would be stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on.&nbsp; What have you to say?&nbsp; I am not
stern; but I have no doubt you will think me unkind.&nbsp; People
are always unkind who do not do what they are asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa says that Herbert Onslow is some day to become a
partner in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on certain circumstances.&nbsp; Neither I
nor your papa can say whether he will or no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Isa went on as though she had not heard the last
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have come to ask you to admit him as a
partner at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I supposed so;&mdash;just as you might ask me to
give you a new ribbon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, uncle, I never did ask you to give me a new
ribbon.&nbsp; I never asked you to give me anything for myself;
nor do I ask this for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that if I could do it,&mdash;which of
course I can&rsquo;t,&mdash;I would not sooner do it for you, who
are my own flesh and blood, than for him, who is a
stranger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay; he is no stranger.&nbsp; He has sat at your desk
and obeyed your orders for nearly four years.&nbsp; Papa says
that he has done well in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&nbsp; If every clerk that does
well,&mdash;pretty well, that is,&mdash;wanted a partnership,
where should we be, my dear?&nbsp; No, my dear, go home and tell
him when you see him in the evening that all this must be at an
end.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s places in the world are not given away so
easily as that.&nbsp; They must either be earned or
purchased.&nbsp; Herbert Onslow has as yet done neither, and
therefore he is not entitled to take a wife.&nbsp; I should have
been glad to have had a wife at his age,&mdash;at least I suppose
I should, but at any rate I could not afford it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Isa had by no means as yet done.&nbsp; So far the
interview had progressed exactly as she had anticipated.&nbsp;
She had never supposed it possible that her uncle would grant her
so important a request as soon as she opened her mouth to ask
it.&nbsp; She had not for a moment expected that things would go
so easily with her.&nbsp; Indeed she had never expected that any
success would attend her efforts; but, if any success were
possible, the work which must achieve that success must now
commence.&nbsp; It was necessary that she should first state her
request plainly before she began to urge it with such eloquence
as she had at her command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand what you say, Uncle Hatto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know that I have no right to ask you for
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say that.&nbsp; Anything in reason, that a
girl like you should ask of her old uncle, I would give
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no such reasonable request to make, uncle.&nbsp;
I have never wanted new ribbons from you or gay toys.&nbsp; Even
from my own mother I have not wanted them;&mdash;not wanted them
faster than they seemed to come without any asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; you have been a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been a happy girl; and quite happy with those I
loved, and with what Providence had given me.&nbsp; I had nothing
to ask for.&nbsp; But now I am no longer happy, nor can I be
unless you do for me this which I ask of you.&nbsp; I have wanted
nothing till now, and now in my need I come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you want a husband with a fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; and that single word she spoke, not loudly,
for her voice was low and soft, but with an accent which carried
it sharply to his ear and to his brain.&nbsp; And then she rose
from her seat as she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your scorn, uncle, is
unjust,&mdash;unjust and untrue.&nbsp; I have ever acted
maidenly, as has become my mother&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes;&mdash;I believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can say more than that for myself.&nbsp; My
thoughts have been the same, nor have my wishes even, ever gone
beyond them.&nbsp; And when this young man came to me, telling me
of his feelings, I gave him no answer till I had consulted my
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should have bade you not to think of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are not a mother, and cannot know.&nbsp; Why
should I not think of him when he was good and kind, honest and
hardworking?&nbsp; And then he had thought of me first.&nbsp; Why
should I not think of him?&nbsp; Did not mamma listen to my
father when he came to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your father was forty years old, and had a
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave it him, Uncle Hatto.&nbsp; I have heard him
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And therefore I am to do as much for you.&nbsp; And
then next year Agnes will come to me; and so before I die I shall
see you all in want, with large families.&nbsp; No, Isa; I will
not scorn you, but this thing I cannot do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have not told you all yet.&nbsp; You say that I
want a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well; I did not mean to say it
harshly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do want&mdash;to be married.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here
her courage failed her a little, and for a moment her eye fell to
the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true, uncle.&nbsp; He has asked me
whether I could love him, and I have told him I could.&nbsp; He
has asked me whether I would be his wife, and I have given him a
promise.&nbsp; After that, must not his happiness be my
happiness, and his misery my misery?&nbsp; Am I not his wife
already before God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Uncle Hatto, loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I am.&nbsp; None feel the strength of the bonds
but those who are themselves bound.&nbsp; I know my duty to my
father and mother, and with God&rsquo;s help I will do it, but I
am not the less bound to him.&nbsp; Without their approval I will
not stand with him at the altar; but not the less is my lot
joined to his for this world.&nbsp; Nothing could release me from
that but his wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he will wish it in a month or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Uncle Hatto, but in that I can only judge
for myself as best I may.&nbsp; He has loved me now for two
years&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whether it be wise or foolish, I have sanctioned
it.&nbsp; I cannot now go back with honour, even if my own heart
would let me.&nbsp; His welfare must be my welfare, and his
sorrow my sorrow.&nbsp; Therefore I am bound to do for him
anything that a girl may do for the man she loves; and, as I knew
of no other resource, I come to you to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he, sitting out there, knows what you are
saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly not.&nbsp; He knows no more than that he
has seen me enter this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that, because I would not wish that he
should be disappointed.&nbsp; In this matter, my dear, I cannot
do anything for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is your last answer, uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&nbsp; When you come to think over this
some twenty years hence, you will know then that I am right, and
that your request was unreasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I do not
think it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be so.&nbsp; Such favours as you now ask are
not granted in this world for light reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light reasons!&nbsp; Well, uncle, I have had my say,
and will not take up your time longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my dear.&nbsp; I am sorry that I cannot
oblige you;&mdash;that it is quite out of my power to oblige
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went, giving him her hand as she parted from him; and
he, as she left the room looked anxiously at her, watching her
countenance and her gait, and listening to the very fall of her
footstep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said to himself; when he was
alone, &ldquo;the young people have the best of it.&nbsp; The sun
shines for them; but why should they have all?&nbsp; Poor as he
is, he is a happy dog,&mdash;a happy dog.&nbsp; But she is twice
too good for him.&nbsp; Why did she not take to one of her own
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isa, as she passed through the bank, smiled sweetly on her
father, and then smiled sweetly at her lover, nodding to him with
a pleasant kindly nod.&nbsp; If he could have heard all that had
passed at that interview, how much more he would have known of
her than he now knew, and how proud he would have been of her
love.&nbsp; No word was spoken as she went out, and then she
walked home with even step, as she had walked thither.&nbsp; It
can hardly be said that she was disappointed, as she had expected
nothing.&nbsp; But people hope who do not expect, and though her
step was even and her face calm, yet her heart was sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is no hope from
Uncle Hatto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I feared, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought it right to try&mdash;for Herbert&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it will not do him an injury in the
bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma, do not put that into my head.&nbsp; If that
were added to it all, I should indeed be wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he is too just for that.&nbsp; Poor young
man!&nbsp; Sometimes I almost think it would be better that he
should go back to England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, if he did, I should&mdash;break my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mamma!&nbsp; But do not suppose that I mean to
complain, whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had been so sure that you had constrained your
feelings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I had,&mdash;till I knew myself.&nbsp; Mamma, I
could wait for years, if he were contented to wait by my
side.&nbsp; If I could see him happy, I could watch him and love
him, and be happy also.&nbsp; I do not want to have him kneeling
to me, and making sweet speeches; but it has gone too far
now,&mdash;and I could not bear to lose him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thus to her mother she confessed the truth.</p>
<p>There was nothing more said between Isa and her mother on the
subject, and for two days the matter remained as it then
stood.&nbsp; Madame Heine had been deeply grieved at hearing
those last words which her daughter had spoken.&nbsp; To her also
that state of quiescence which Isa had so long affected seemed to
be the proper state at which a maiden&rsquo;s heart should stand
till after her marriage vows had been pronounced.&nbsp; She had
watched her Isa, and had approved of everything,&mdash;of
everything till this last avowal had been made.&nbsp; But now,
though she could not approve, she expressed no disapproval in
words.&nbsp; She pressed her daughter&rsquo;s hand and sighed,
and then the two said no more upon the matter.&nbsp; In this way,
for two days, there was silence in the apartments in the Ludwigs
Strasse; for even when the father returned from his work, the
whole circle felt that their old family mirth was for the present
necessarily laid aside.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, about noon, Madame Heine
returned home from the market with Isa, and as they reached the
landing, Agnes met them with a packet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fritz brought
it from the bank,&rdquo; said Agnes.&nbsp; Now Fritz was the boy
who ran messages and swept out the office, and Madame Heine put
out her hand for the parcel, thinking, not unnaturally, that it
was for her.&nbsp; But Agnes would not give it to her mother,
&ldquo;It is for you, Isa,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Then Isa,
looking at the address, recognised the handwriting of her
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will come to
you directly;&rdquo; and then she passed quickly away into her
own room.</p>
<p>The parcel was soon opened, and contained a note from her
uncle, and a stiff, large document, looking as though it had come
from the hands of a lawyer.&nbsp; Isa glanced at the document,
and read some few of the words on the outer fold, but they did
not carry home to her mind any clear perception of their
meaning.&nbsp; She was flurried at the moment, and the words,
perhaps, were not very plain.&nbsp; Then she took up her note,
and that was plain enough.&nbsp; It was very short, and ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear Niece,</p>
<p>You told me on Monday that I was stern, and harsh, and
unjust.&nbsp; Perhaps I was.&nbsp; If so, I hope the enclosed
will make amends, and that you will not think me such an old fool
as I think myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your affectionate uncle,<br
/>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hatto Heine</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told nobody yet, and the enclosed will require
my brother&rsquo;s signature; but I suppose he will not
object.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he does not know it, mamma,&rdquo; said Isa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who is to tell him?&nbsp; Oh, mamma, you must tell
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear; but it must be your own present to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not give it him.&nbsp; It is Uncle
Hatto&rsquo;s present Mamma, when I left him I thought that his
eye was kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His heart, at any rate, has been very
kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then again they looked over the document,
and talked of the wedding which must now be near at hand.&nbsp;
But still they had not as yet decided how Herbert should be
informed.</p>
<p>At last Isa resolved that she herself would write to
him.&nbsp; She did write, and this was her letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Herbert,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma and I wish to see you, and beg that you will come
up to us this evening.&nbsp; We have tidings for you which I hope
you will receive with joy.&nbsp; I may as well tell you at once,
as I do not wish to flurry you.&nbsp; Uncle Hatto has sent to us
a document which admits you as a partner into the bank.&nbsp; If;
therefore, you wish to go on with our engagement, I suppose there
is nothing now to cause any very great delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Isa</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter was very simple, and Isa, when she had written it,
subsided into all her customary quiescence.&nbsp; Indeed, when
Herbert came to the Ludwigs Strasse, not in the evening as he was
bidden to do, but instantly, leaving his own dinner uneaten, and
coming upon the Heines in the midst of their dinner, she was more
than usually tranquil.&nbsp; But his love was, as she had told
him, boisterous.&nbsp; He could not contain himself, and embraced
them all, and then scolded Isa because she was so calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I not be calm,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;now
that I know you are happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house in the Schrannen Platz still goes by the name of
Heine Brothers, but the mercantile world in Bavaria, and in some
cities out of Bavaria, is well aware that the real pith and
marrow of the business is derived from the energy of the young
English partner.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
